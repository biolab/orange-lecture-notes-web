Welcome! We have designed this workshop for students of
biomedicine interested in interactive single-cell gene expression
data analysis. You will see how you can accomplish single-cell data
mining tasks without programming. We will use Orange, its
bioinformatics and single-cell add-ons to construct reproducible,
shareable, and visual data mining workflows.

If you havenâ€™t already installed Orange, please download the
installation package from https://orange.biolab.si, install Orange,
and then install the add-ons for Bioinformatics and Single-Cell
Data Analysis.
