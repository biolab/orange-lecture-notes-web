date: 'May 2022'
aside:
  - These notes include orange workflows and visualizations we will construct during the course. 
  - These notes were written by Blaž Zupan with a huge help from the members of the Bioinformatics Lab in Ljubljana that develop and maintain orange. In part, we have reused lecture notes for Orange and orange workshops as designed by the same group.
chapters:
  - classification
  - regression

Welcome! We have designed this workshop for students of
biomedicine interested in interactive single-cell gene expression
data analysis. You will see how you can accomplish single-cell data
mining tasks without programming. We will use Orange, its
bioinformatics and single-cell add-ons to construct reproducible,
shareable, and visual data mining workflows.

If you haven’t already installed Orange, please download the
installation package from https://orange.biolab.si, install Orange,
and then install the add-ons for Bioinformatics and Single-Cell
Data Analysis.
