This is an accompany material for the short, four-hour lecture for
Ph. D. students that took the course on functional genomics at University of Ljubljana. These working notes include some of the Orange
workflows we had constructed during the lectures. Throughout our
training, the students saw how to accomplish various data mining tasks
through visual programming and use Orange to build visual data mining workflows. Many similar data mining environments exist, but the
lecturers prefer Orange for one simple reason—they are its authors.
If you haven’t already installed Orange, please download the installation package from http://orangedatamining.com.

The notes were written by Blaˇz Zupan and Janez Demˇsar with help
from the members of the Bioinformatics Lab in Ljubljana, Slovenia,
that developed Orange. We would specifically like to thank Ajda Pretnar Zagar and Marko Toplak for proofreading, editing, and converting ˇ
our previous documents in Pages to LaTeX.
