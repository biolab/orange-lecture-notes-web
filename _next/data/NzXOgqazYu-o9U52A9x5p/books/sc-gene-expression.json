We have designed this workshop for students of\nbiomedicine interested in interactive single-cell gene expression\ndata analysis. You will see how you can accomplish single-cell data\nmining tasks without programming. We will use Orange, its\nbioinformatics and single-cell add-ons to construct reproducible,\nshareable, and visual data mining workflows.\n\nIf you havenâ€™t already installed Orange, please download the\ninstallation package from https://orange.biolab.si, install Orange,\nand then install the add-ons for Bioinformatics and Single-Cell\nData Analysis.\n\n<!!! width-30 !!!>\n![](fig1.png)\n\n***Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs CC BY-NC-ND***","chapters":[],"slug":"sc-gene-expression"},"__N_SSG":true}
